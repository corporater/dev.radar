Domain Driven Design,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a software desgin approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. It has become the primary KEY to scaling software companies and to autonomous teams and efficient collaboration.</p><p>When applying DDD, we normally differentiate between<br>* Strategic Design, which is the design where domain experts meet the developers and agree on features, language (ubiquitous language) boundaries (bounded contexts).<br>* Tactical Design, which is the design where architects and developers agree on technical approaches and how to collaborate with other contexts. That might be by providing well known context mapping techniques, like anti-corruption layer, API's etc</p><p>DDD was invented by Eric Evans in 2003 and got lot of attention to many developers at that time. However, since the technology was still providing On-Premis solutions build as monolitic applications, DDD was often seen as an overengineered way of thinking and working (thereby also expensive). However, as SaaS and Cloud-expectations settled into the big companies from 2014, they found that DDD was a fundamental practice and knowlegde to success, reduced innovation time and cost. Now (2022) it is the primary KEY to anonomous teams and scaling software companies.</p><p>DDD cannot be applied by knowing the headlines only. Experience by success and failure is needed. To gain more information about DDD or get a jumping start for your project in Corporater, contact Jarle Berge or Geir Eilertsen</p>"
Microservices,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,TBD
DevOps,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Remove silos and break down barriers between Development and Operations (DevOps). Focus on 1) flow of work, 2) feedback and 3) continuous learning and experimentation. See books such as 'The DevOps Handbook' and 'Accelerate'."
Monolith,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"By placing this here we want to indicate that one should take great care to not lump further new features into our existing monolith. New services may still choose to adopt a ""monolith first"" approach as they will presumably still be of a far smaller scope than BMP itself"
Session-based authentication,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,This is how authentication is handled between the browser and BMP-backend today
Token-based authentication,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"When more than one service is used to power the client, session based authentication becomes cumbersome. We want to migrate to a fully token-based strategy where tokens are issued centrally and can be verified locally by each service"
IAC,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"Infrastructure as code. As we move towards a multi-service architecture, we will need to become proficient in this area to avoid brittle deployments and unicorn servers"
The twelve factor app,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,https://12factor.net/
CircleCI,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,Our current CI/CD provider: https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/corporater/
GitHub,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,All our code lives here: https://github.com/corporater
GitHub Actions,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,"Most of our automation needs are currently covered by CircleCI, but we see that GitHub Actions has good traction and might provide a good alternative for some use-cases. Killer use-case(s) and a strategy for dealing with the complexity/fragmentation that may arise from splitting efforts between GA and CircleCI needed!"
DockerHub,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,"We are currently using DockerHub as our main container repository, however, there might be benefits from switching to AWS ECR, this is currently being investigated"
AWS ECR,Trial,Platforms,TRUE,Continuous builds are pushed here as it is easier to integrate with our IAC efforts
VeraCode,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"We want BMP to have a VeraCode stamp of approval for security. This certificate is important for many clients. All builds are uploaded to VeraCode and subjected to static scan, we also get manual penetration tests"
AWS S3,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"Build artifacts (installers, tar'ed images) are published/stored here. We should consider if we can make this replace ShareFile alltogether"
JFrog,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,Package repository. Intermediary artifacts are uploaded here and used during build process. https://corporater.jfrog.io/ui/packages
Camunda,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"The engine that powers our process management offering. Currently embedded in the BMP VM, but a prime candidate for deployment as a separate service"
Prometheus,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Exposes metrics from BMP as a standard REST endpoint. Other services should use this as well, though the usage-scope is not defined and is left up to each team"
Grafana,Trial,Tools,TRUE,"Visualize metrics as dashboards. Used by Saas/Service&Support. They have constructed a ""standard"" dashboard for BMP, but Grafana itself is highly configurable"
Figma,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,Chosen as our main tool for wireframing/prototyping and shared whiteboard
IntelliJ 2021,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Still being widely used, but we would suggest upgrading to 2022"
Visual Studio Code,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,TBD
IntelliJ 2022,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,Latest and greatest IntelliJ. Featuring a splash-screen that does not cause seizures
Maven,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,Our build tool. Used locally and by CircleCI
JProfiler,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"We only have a single license for this, which, coupled with a slightly convoluted workflow, means we might not be profiling as much as we should. Are there other options?"
Cypress,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,E2E-testing platform. Can be run locally and is used by CircleCI
Install4j,Hold,Tools,TRUE,Install4j solves many of the same challenges as docker/containers. Our cloud-first strategy means that we should probably put greater emphasis on how we run our services in containers and less on how they are deployed on prem
Snyk,Trial,Tools,TRUE,Container images are currently scanned for library-vulnerabilites using Snyk
Docker,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,Our preferred container technology. All services should produce images as part of their build workflow
Java17,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,We are currently in the process of migrating to this. Any new services should be using this from the get-go
Go,Trial,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,This is being tested by the CDE-team and currently powers the backend for iac.admin
Terraform,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,This is our format for IAC. It is the most popular offering in this segment
Java8,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,"Any new services/libraries/repos should not use this, though we have not taken the plunge for bmp.bmp yet"
React,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,Our primary front-end framework. Recommended as the front-end backbone for all services
Spring,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,"New services should be based on spring-boot. We are aware that the framework comes with a fair bit of overhead in terms of complexity and weight of JAR-files, but we feel that the gains in terms of utility, push towards good code practices and possibility of unification/streamlining between services is well worth it"
ag-grid,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,Front-end tables. Widely used in BMP. Due to license cost and complexity may not be suitable for small use-cases in other products/services
Apollo-client,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,Front-end graphql client. Included here as an indication that graphql is our chosen protocol for frontend-backend communications
JUL,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,BMP uses JUL for logging. Other services use JUL over SLF4J
