## Corporater-specific changes and clarifications

### Quadrants

They have been kept the same as the original. The original quadrants are quite sensible and for some they have the added bonus of being familiar

### Rings

#### Adopt

Blips appearing here represent something that we're actively advocating the use of. This might mean we're already using it, or it may signal a clear decision to start using it.

#### Trial

Something that someone in the organization is testing in practice. There will be code/artifacts somewhere that could function as an example of how to use it

#### Assess

The normal starting point for a new entity. Something that we want to consider for adoption, but have not started experiments with

#### Hold

Blips in Hold represent something that we want to minimize the use of. This does not mean all associated code should be immediately deleted, rather that new projects should consider going in a different direction and existing code should be a candidate for upgrade/refactoring if touched

## Participation

Team-leads and other interested parties will be invited to quarterly official reviews of the radar

All Corporater Dev employees/consultants should feel free to add a pull request if they feel that something is missing, misplaced or superfluous. The tech-lead will be most grateful if they also drop him a line on Teams as he may not be checking in on this repo daily
